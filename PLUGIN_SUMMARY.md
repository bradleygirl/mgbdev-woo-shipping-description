# WooCommerce Shipping Description Plugin - Implementation Summary

## Files Created

### 1. mgbdev-woo-shipping-description.php
**Location:** Plugin root directory  
**Purpose:** Main plugin file containing all functionality

**Key Features:**
- **WooCommerce Dependency Check:** Verifies WooCommerce is active before initializing
- **Admin Settings Integration:** Adds a custom "Description" textarea field to all shipping method settings
- **Classic Display:** Uses `woocommerce_after_shipping_rate` hook to display descriptions on classic cart/checkout
- **Block Display:** Uses `woocommerce_package_rates` filter and JavaScript to inject descriptions into block-based cart/checkout
- **Security:** Properly escapes output using `wp_kses_post()` and `esc_html()`
- **Performance:** Only loads CSS/JS on cart/checkout pages

**How It Works:**
1. Immediately registers custom fields for all shipping methods via `register_shipping_method_fields()`
2. Filters `woocommerce_shipping_instance_form_fields_{method_id}` to add description field
3. Saves description with shipping method instance settings
4. Retrieves and displays description on frontend using:
   - `woocommerce_package_rates` filter to attach descriptions to rate objects
   - `woocommerce_after_shipping_rate` action for classic themes
   - JavaScript with `wp_localize_script()` for block themes

- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Support for both classic and block-based checkout

### 3. assets/js/shipping-description-blocks.js
**Location:** assets/js/

**Key Features:**

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Description Field Not Appearing in Admin
**Problem:** The description text field was not being added to shipping method edit screens.

**Root Cause:** Line 76 was calling `add_action('woocommerce_init', ...)` from within the `init()` method, which itself was already running on `woocommerce_init`. This created a timing issue where the field registration wouldn't happen until the next request.

**Fix:** Changed to call `$this->register_shipping_method_fields()` directly instead of hooking it again.

### Bug #2: Descriptions Not Displaying on Frontend
**Problem:** Saved description text was not appearing under shipping methods on cart and checkout pages.

**Root Cause:** Multiple issues:
1. The `woocommerce_package_rates` filter wasn't being used to attach descriptions to rate objects
2. The block implementation used `render_block` filter which doesn't work with client-side rendered WooCommerce blocks
3. Description retrieval logic wasn't properly parsing rate IDs

**Fix:**
1. Added `woocommerce_package_rates` filter to attach descriptions to rate objects before display
2. Replaced `render_block` approach with JavaScript + `wp_localize_script()` for blocks
3. Improved rate ID parsing in `get_rate_description()` method
4. Added `get_shipping_method_instance()` helper to properly retrieve shipping method instances from zones

### Block Display (Cart/Checkout)
- Uses `woocommerce_package_rates` filter to prepare description data
- Uses `wp_localize_script()` to pass descriptions to JavaScript

- Handles WooCommerce block events for cart/checkout updates
