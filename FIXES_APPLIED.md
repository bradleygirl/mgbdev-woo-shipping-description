# Fixes Applied to WooCommerce Shipping Description Plugin

## Date: October 27, 2025

## Summary
Fixed two critical bugs preventing the plugin from working correctly:
1. Description field not appearing in admin
2. Descriptions not displaying on cart/checkout pages

---

## Bug #1: Description Field Not Appearing in Admin

### Problem
The "Description" textarea field was not being added to each shipping method's edit screen in WooCommerce admin.

### Root Cause
In `mgbdev-woo-shipping-description.php` at line 76, the code was attempting to add an action hook to `woocommerce_init` from within the `init()` method, which itself was already executing on the `woocommerce_init` hook:

```php
// INCORRECT - This creates a timing issue
public function init() {
    add_action( 'woocommerce_init', array( $this, 'register_shipping_method_fields' ) );
    // ...
}
```

This created a circular hook dependency where the field registration wouldn't occur until the next page request.

### Fix Applied
Changed line 76 to call the method directly instead of hooking it again:

```php
// CORRECT - Direct method call
public function init() {
    $this->register_shipping_method_fields();
    // ...
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `mgbdev-woo-shipping-description.php` (line 76)

## Bug #2: Descriptions Not Displaying on Frontend

### Problem
Even after saving descriptions in the admin, the text was not appearing below shipping methods on cart and checkout pages (both classic and block themes).

### Root Causes
Multiple issues contributed to this bug:

1. **Missing Rate Filter:** The plugin wasn't using the `woocommerce_package_rates` filter to attach descriptions to shipping rate objects before display.

2. **Broken Block Implementation:** The block checkout implementation used the `render_block` filter, which doesn't work for WooCommerce blocks because they're rendered client-side via React, not server-side.

3. **Inadequate Rate Retrieval:** The description retrieval logic wasn't properly handling shipping rate IDs and instance lookups.

### Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Added `woocommerce_package_rates` Filter
Added a new filter to attach descriptions to shipping rate objects:

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_package_rates', array( $this, 'add_description_to_rates' ), 10, 2 );

public function add_description_to_rates( $rates, $package ) {
    foreach ( $rates as $rate ) {
        $description = $this->get_rate_description( $rate );
        if ( ! empty( $description ) ) {
            $rate->description = $description;
        }
    }
    return $rates;
}
```

#### Fix 2: Rewrote Block Implementation
Replaced the `render_block` approach with a proper JavaScript + PHP solution:

**PHP Side:**
- Added `wp_localize_script()` to pass shipping descriptions to JavaScript
- Created `localize_shipping_descriptions()` method to fetch all descriptions from database
- Added conditional loading to only enqueue JavaScript on block pages

**JavaScript Side:**
- Created new file: `assets/js/shipping-description-blocks.js`
- Implements MutationObserver to detect dynamically loaded shipping options
- Reads descriptions from `mgbdevShippingDescriptions` global variable
- Injects description HTML after each shipping rate label
- Handles WooCommerce block events for cart/checkout updates

#### Fix 3: Improved Rate Description Retrieval
Completely rewrote the description retrieval logic:

**Removed Methods:**
- `get_shipping_method_description()` - incomplete implementation
- `get_description_for_rate_id()` - didn't handle all cases

**Added Methods:**
- `get_rate_description($rate)` - Properly parses rate IDs and retrieves descriptions
- `get_shipping_method_instance($method_id, $instance_id)` - Fetches shipping method instances from zones

```php
private function get_rate_description( $rate ) {
    // Parse rate ID (format: method_id:instance_id)
    $parts = explode( ':', $rate->id );
    $method_id = $parts[0];
    $instance_id = $parts[1];
    
    // Try to get from method instance first
    $shipping_method = $this->get_shipping_method_instance( $method_id, $instance_id );
    if ( $shipping_method ) {
        $description = $shipping_method->get_instance_option( 'description' );
        if ( ! empty( $description ) ) {
            return $description;
        }
    }
    
    // Fallback: get directly from options table
    $instance_settings = get_option( 'woocommerce_' . $method_id . '_' . $instance_id . '_settings', array() );
    return $instance_settings['description'] ?? '';
}
```

#### Fix 4: Enhanced Classic Display
Updated the classic display method to check for descriptions attached to rate objects:

```php
public function display_classic_shipping_description( $method, $index ) {
    // Check if description is already set on the rate object
    if ( isset( $method->description ) && ! empty( $method->description ) ) {
        printf(
            '<div class="shipping-method-description">%s</div>',
            wp_kses_post( $method->description )
        );
        return;
    }
    
    // Fallback: try to get description directly
    $description = $this->get_rate_description( $method );
    // ...
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `mgbdev-woo-shipping-description.php` (lines 74-345)

**Files Created:**
- `assets/js/shipping-description-blocks.js` (new file, 109 lines)

---

## Additional Improvements

### Added Backward Compatibility Check
Added a check for older WordPress versions that don't have the `has_block()` function:

```php
if ( function_exists( 'has_block' ) && ( has_block( 'woocommerce/cart' ) || has_block( 'woocommerce/checkout' ) ) ) {
    // Enqueue block-specific JavaScript
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Why `woocommerce_package_rates` Filter?
This filter is the standard WooCommerce way to modify shipping rates before they're displayed. It runs after rates are calculated but before display, making it the perfect place to attach custom metadata.

### Why JavaScript for Blocks?
WooCommerce blocks use React and render content client-side, so server-side HTML manipulation via `render_block` doesn't work. The solution requires:
1. PHP to prepare and localize data
2. JavaScript to inject content into the DOM
3. MutationObserver to handle dynamic updates

### Rate ID Format
WooCommerce shipping rate IDs follow the format: `{method_id}:{instance_id}`
- Example: `flat_rate:3` or `free_shipping:5`
- This is parsed to retrieve the correct shipping method instance and its settings
